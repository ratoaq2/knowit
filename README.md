## Why knowit

Different tools give video metadata in different formats and with different names. knowit reads the
output of MediaInfo, ffprobe, mkvmerge, or enzyme. It gives the result in one format, with the same names
and units for all of them. You can use knowit as a command or as a Python library.

## Quick start

1. Install knowit:

   ```bash
   uv tool install "knowit[pint]"
   ```

2. Read a video:

   ```text
   $ knowit movie.mkv
   {
       "title": "Big Buck Bunny",
       "path": "movie.mkv",
       "duration": "0:00:46",
       "size": "31.76 MB",
       "bit_rate": "5.4 Mbps",
       "container": "mkv",
       "video": [
           {
               "id": 1,
               "width": "1024 pixel",
               "height": "576 pixel",
               "resolution": "576p",
               "frame_rate": "24.0 FPS",
               "codec": "H.264",
               ...
           }
       ],
       "audio": [
           {
               "id": 2,
               "codec": "AAC",
               "channels": "2.0",
               "sampling_rate": "48.0 KHz",
               ...
           }
       ],
       "subtitle": [
           {
               "id": 3,
               "language": "English",
               "format": "SubRip",
               "default": true
           },
           ...
       ]
   }
   ```

To try knowit without installing it, use `uvx knowit movie.mkv`.

## Installation

### Install knowit

Use one of these commands:

| Command | When to use it |
| --- | --- |
| `uv tool install "knowit[pint]"` | Recommended. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) also installs Python if necessary. |
| `pipx install "knowit[pint]"` | You already use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/). |
| `pip install knowit` | You want to use knowit as a Python library. |

The `pint` extra adds units to the values, for example `31.76 MB` or `1024 pixel`. Without it, knowit
shows plain numbers.

To upgrade, use `uv tool upgrade knowit` or `pipx upgrade knowit`.

### Install a provider

A provider is the program that knowit uses to read the file. knowit uses the first installed provider in
this order:

| Provider | Program | Files | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mediainfo` | [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/MediaInfo) | All video files | Default. Gives the most information. |
| `ffmpeg` | ffprobe, from [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) | All video files | |
| `mkvmerge` | mkvmerge, from [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html) | `.mkv`, `.mka`, `.mks` | |
| `enzyme` | Included in knowit | `.mkv` | Gives less information. |

On most systems, knowit installs the MediaInfo library with the
[pymediainfo](https://github.com/sbraz/pymediainfo) package. You do not need to install more programs.

If your system has no MediaInfo library, or if you want other providers, install the programs:

**Ubuntu, Debian, and WSL**

```bash
sudo apt-get install mediainfo ffmpeg mkvtoolnix
```

**Windows** (with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/))

```bash
choco install mediainfo ffmpeg mkvtoolnix
```

**macOS** (with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))

```bash
brew install media-info ffmpeg mkvtoolnix
```

To see which providers knowit finds, run `knowit --version`.

### Docker

The [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ratoaq2/knowit) contains knowit, MediaInfo, FFmpeg, and
MKVToolNix:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /medias:/medias ratoaq2/knowit /medias/movie.mkv
```

## Usage

Read a video with a specific provider:

```bash
knowit -p ffmpeg movie.mkv
```

Show the result in YAML:

```bash
knowit -y movie.mkv
```

A profile changes how knowit shows the values. The same file with two profiles:

```text
$ knowit -y -P human movie.mkv        $ knowit -y -P technical movie.mkv
  duration: 46 seconds                  duration: '0:00:46.665000'
  size: 31.76 MB                        size: 30.291 MiB
  bit_rate: 5.4 Mbps                    bit_rate: 5.193 Mibps
```

### Main options

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `-p`, `--provider` | Use this provider: `mediainfo`, `ffmpeg`, `mkvmerge`, or `enzyme`. |
| `-y`, `--yaml` | Show the result in YAML. The default is JSON. |
| `-P`, `--profile` | Show the values with this profile: `default`, `human`, `technical`, or `code`. |
| `-N`, `--no-units` | Show the values without units. |
| `--mediainfo`, `--ffmpeg`, `--mkvmerge` | Look for the program in this folder. |
| `--report` | Read a folder and list the values that knowit does not know. |
| `--bug-report` | Write a file to attach to an issue. See [Report a problem](#report-a-problem). |
| `--version` | Show the knowit version and the providers that knowit finds. |

Run `knowit --help` for all options.

### Python API

```python
from knowit import know

info = know('/medias/movie.mkv')
print(info['video'][0]['codec'])  # H.264

info = know('/medias/movie.mkv', {'provider': 'ffmpeg', 'profile': 'code'})
```

`know` returns a `dict`. It raises `KnowitException` when knowit cannot read the file.

## Report a problem

Do not send your media file. Run this command instead, and attach `knowit-report.yml` to an
[issue](https://github.com/ratoaq2/knowit/issues):

```bash
knowit --bug-report "/path/to/your/video.mkv"
```

The report contains the output of every provider. Titles, file names, and free-text tags are masked.

When the problem is the name of the file, use `knowit --check-name "The Accountant² (2025).mkv"`. It
tells you which provider fails because of the name.

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/ratoaq2/knowit/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md) gives all the
details.

## Help to improve knowit

knowit is more correct when it sees many different files. Run this command on your library, and attach
the files that it writes to an [issue](https://github.com/ratoaq2/knowit/issues):

```bash
knowit --collect /path/to/your/media
```

Your media is not needed. Titles and file names are masked. See
[Help to improve knowit](https://github.com/ratoaq2/knowit/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#help-to-improve-knowit).

## FAQ

**Which provider should I use?**
Use MediaInfo if you can. It gives the most information. If knowit gives a wrong value, try another
provider with `-p`, and [report the problem](#report-a-problem).

**Which files does knowit read?**
With MediaInfo or ffprobe, knowit reads all common video files, for example `.mkv`, `.mp4`, `.avi`, and
`.ts`. With only mkvmerge or enzyme, knowit reads only Matroska files (`.mkv`).

**Does knowit send my files or file names anywhere?**
No. knowit reads the files on your computer. It does not use the network. A bug report or a collect file
leaves your computer only when you attach it to an issue.
